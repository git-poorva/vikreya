            <h1>Amazon Listing Health Score: What It Means and How to Fix It</h1>
            <p class="article-lead">Amazon's algorithm scores your listing quality and uses it to decide where you rank. Most sellers have 4–5 fixable issues they don't know about. Here's the breakdown and exactly what to fix first.</p>
            <div class="article-meta">

            </div>
        </header>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Your listing health score isn't just about how pretty your page looks. Amazon uses these signals to determine whether you deserve placement in search results. A listing with a score of 6/10 competes at a disadvantage against a score of 9/10 — even if your reviews and price are identical.</p>

            <h2>The 6 factors that actually matter</h2>

            <h3>Title length and keyword density</h3>
            <p>Amazon.in allows up to 200 characters for most categories. Most sellers use 80–100. Your title should lead with your primary keyword, include 2–3 secondary keywords naturally, and end with a key product differentiator. Don't stuff — Amazon can detect it and it hurts readability (which hurts conversion).</p>

            <h3>Bullet points: length and completeness</h3>
            <p>Five bullet points, each 150–200 characters, each starting with a capitalized feature or benefit. Listings with fewer than 5 bullets or very short bullets get scored down. Each bullet should answer a real customer question: what does this feature do for me?</p>

            <h3>Images: count and quality</h3>
            <p>You get 9 image slots. Use all of them. The algorithm checks for image count. The mandatory shots: main product on white, lifestyle/in-use, size reference, feature callouts, packaging. At least one video dramatically improves conversion rate — Amazon increasingly factors conversion rate into search rankings.</p>

            <h3>Backend keywords</h3>
            <p>250 bytes of backend keywords. Most sellers fill these with duplicates of their title keywords. Instead, use this space for: Hindi search terms (बेस्ट प्रोडक्ट), common misspellings, category synonyms, and long-tail variations. These words don't appear on your page but Amazon indexes them for search.</p>

            <h3>Product description / A+ content</h3>
            <p>Listings without A+ Content score significantly lower. If you're brand registered, A+ Content is free — use it. If you're not brand registered, fill the description field completely. A blank description is a guaranteed score penalty.</p>

            <h3>Missing category-specific attributes</h3>
            <p>Every category has required and recommended attributes. Go to your listing in Seller Central and check the "Vital Info" and "More Details" tabs. Empty fields that Amazon marks as "recommended" are costing you points. Fill every field you can.</p>

            <h2>Quick audit: where to start</h2>
            <p>Open your listing in Seller Central. Go to Manage Inventory → click the listing → Edit. Count your bullets, check your image count, review your title length. If any of the six areas above are incomplete, that's your first fix. Prioritize: images → title → bullets → backend keywords → A+ content → attributes.</p>
