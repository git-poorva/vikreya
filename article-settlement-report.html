            <h1>How to Actually Read Your Amazon Settlement Report</h1>
            <p class="article-lead">Amazon pays you every 14 days and sends a Settlement Report with thousands of rows. Most sellers ignore it. That's expensive. Here's what to check every single payout cycle — and what it reveals about your true profitability.</p>
            <div class="article-meta">

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Your Settlement Report is the financial truth of your Amazon business. Everything else — your orders, your inventory, your ads — eventually shows up here as money in or money out. Download it from <strong>Reports → Payments → Settlement</strong> and open it in Excel or Google Sheets.</p>

            <h2>The 4 columns that matter most</h2>

            <h3>Transaction type</h3>
            <p>This tells you what each row is. The ones to pay attention to: <code>order</code> (revenue), <code>refund</code> (money you paid back), <code>FBA inbound transportation fee</code>, <code>FBA fulfillment fee</code>, <code>storage fee</code>, and <code>FBA_REIMBURSEMENT</code>. Filter by each one separately to understand your cost breakdown.</p>

            <h3>Amount</h3>
            <p>Negative numbers are money Amazon took from you. Positive numbers are money owed to you. Simple enough — but the dangerous ones are small negative amounts repeated thousands of times. Filter by transaction type = "FBA fulfillment fee" and look for unexpected variations in fee amounts for the same ASIN. If your product's fee keeps changing, Amazon may have miscategorized your product's size.</p>

            <h3>Quantity</h3>
            <p>Always cross-reference quantity against your order reports. If you see refund transactions where quantity = 1 but no corresponding positive adjustment in your FBA Inventory Ledger, that's a reimbursement case — you were refunded for a unit you never got back.</p>

            <h3>Order ID / ASIN</h3>
            <p>For any row that looks wrong — unexpected fee, large refund, missing reimbursement — you can trace it back to the original order using the Order ID. This is your audit trail. Document everything you dispute with the relevant Order ID and transaction date.</p>

            <h2>Three things to check every payout cycle</h2>

            <p><strong>1. Total refunds vs last cycle</strong> — A sudden spike in refunds for one ASIN usually means a product quality issue or a fake return scheme. Catch it early.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Storage fees vs inventory level</strong> — If your storage fees went up but your inventory went down, something's wrong. Amazon may be billing you for inventory that's already been removed or disposed of.</p>

            <p><strong>3. FBA fulfillment fees by ASIN</strong> — Sort by ASIN and look for any ASIN where the fee per unit has changed unexpectedly. This is how you catch fee discrepancies before they compound over hundreds of orders.</p>

            <h2>The 14-day window matters</h2>
            <p>Amazon's reimbursement claims process has time limits — most cases must be filed within 18 months of the transaction, but the sooner you spot discrepancies, the easier it is to resolve them with accurate supporting data. Make the Settlement Report check a monthly ritual.</p>
