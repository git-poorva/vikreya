            <p>A home decor seller in Mumbai was sitting on 800 units of a product that hadn't sold in 4 months. Storage fees: ₹14,200. Meanwhile, her bestselling product went out of stock for 11 days during Diwali season. Lost sales: conservatively ₹42,000.</p>

            <p>An electronics seller in Bangalore kept reordering inventory every 3 weeks based on "gut feel." His average inventory turnover was 4.2 times per year — well below the category average of 8-10x. The slow churn meant his cash was locked up in dead stock instead of being reinvested in winning products.</p>

            <p>These scenarios happen every single day to Amazon FBA sellers in India. Not because sellers don't care — but because they're making inventory decisions without looking at the right data.</p>

            <p>Your Business Report and Inventory Health Report have everything you need to fix this. Most sellers just don't know how to use them.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #1: Overstocking slow-moving products</h2>

            <h3>What it looks like</h3>

            <p>You place a bulk order for 500 units to get a better per-unit cost from your manufacturer. The product sells 40 units/month. You now have 12.5 months of inventory sitting in Amazon's warehouse, accruing storage fees every single month.</p>

            <h3>Why it happens</h3>

            <p>Most sellers overstock for two reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>MOQ pressure</strong> – Your manufacturer requires a minimum order quantity that's way higher than your actual demand. You take it anyway because you don't want to deal with finding a new supplier.</li>
                <li><strong>Fear of stockouts</strong> – You overcompensate by ordering extra "just in case." But that safety buffer becomes permanent bloat.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The real cost</h3>

            <p>Amazon's storage fees in India are structured as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>₹26 per cubic foot per month (January-September)</li>
                <li>₹36 per cubic foot per month (October-December)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If your product is 0.5 cubic feet and you're holding 400 excess units, you're paying ₹5,200/month during non-peak and ₹7,200/month during peak. Over a year, that's ₹69,600 in storage fees alone — not counting the opportunity cost of capital tied up in slow inventory.</p>

            <h3>How to fix it</h3>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Calculate your actual sell-through rate</strong></p>

            <p>Go to your Business Report. Download the "Detail Page Sales and Traffic" report for the last 90 days. For each ASIN, calculate:</p>

            <p><strong>Average daily sales = Total units sold ÷ 90 days</strong></p>

            <p>If a product sells 120 units in 90 days, your average daily sales are 1.33 units/day, or ~40 units/month.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Set inventory targets based on sell-through + safety stock</strong></p>

            <p>A good formula for restock quantity:</p>

            <p><strong>Restock quantity = (Average daily sales × Reorder lead time in days) + Safety stock</strong></p>

            <p>Example: If you sell 1.33 units/day, your supplier lead time is 30 days, and you want 15 days of safety stock:</p>

            <p>Restock quantity = (1.33 × 30) + (1.33 × 15) = 40 + 20 = 60 units</p>

            <p>That's it. 60 units. Not 500.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Negotiate smaller MOQs or find a more flexible supplier</strong></p>

            <p>If your MOQ forces you to overstock, that's a supplier problem, not an inventory problem. Options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask your current supplier for partial shipments spread over 3-4 months</li>
                <li>Find a new supplier with lower MOQs (yes, per-unit cost will be higher, but you'll save on storage fees and free up cash)</li>
                <li>Partner with another seller to split large MOQs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mistake #2: Understocking your bestsellers</h2>

            <h3>What it looks like</h3>

            <p>Your top-selling product goes out of stock. Sales drop to zero. You scramble to reorder but it takes 3-4 weeks for new inventory to arrive. By the time you're back in stock, you've lost your Best Seller badge, your organic ranking dropped, and your competitors ate your market share.</p>

            <h3>Why it happens</h3>

            <p>Sellers understock bestsellers for three reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cash flow constraints</strong> – You can't afford to order enough inventory to cover demand, so you ration your budget across all SKUs instead of prioritizing winners.</li>
                <li><strong>Underestimating demand spikes</strong> – You base reorders on average sales, ignoring seasonal peaks or promotional velocity.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor lead time planning</strong> – You wait until you're nearly out of stock before reordering, leaving no buffer for shipping delays or manufacturing issues.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The real cost</h3>

            <p>Stockouts don't just cost you the sales you miss during the out-of-stock period. They cost you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic rank drop</strong> – Amazon's algorithm sees no sales velocity and pushes you down in search results. Even after restocking, it can take 2-4 weeks to recover your previous ranking.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Buy Box</strong> – If you're out of stock, competitors (or Amazon itself) take the Buy Box. Customers who were loyal to your brand might switch.</li>
                <li><strong>Wasted PPC spend</strong> – If you're running ads while out of stock, you're paying for clicks that go to an unavailable product page. Pure waste.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A kitchen appliance seller in Delhi went out of stock for 9 days on their hero product (avg 180 units/month). Direct lost sales: ₹54,000. Organic rank dropped from page 1 position 4 to page 2 position 18. Even after restocking, it took 6 weeks to climb back to page 1. Total impact: estimated ₹1.8 lakh in lost revenue.</p>

            <h3>How to fix it</h3>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Prioritize inventory budget to high-velocity products</strong></p>

            <p>Download your Business Report. Sort by "Units Ordered" (highest to lowest). Your top 20% of SKUs probably drive 70-80% of your revenue. These are the products you cannot afford to stockout on.</p>

            <p>Allocate your inventory budget accordingly. If you have ₹2 lakh to invest in inventory this month, put ₹1.6 lakh into your top 5 SKUs and ₹40,000 into the rest.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Use a reorder point formula</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Reorder point = (Average daily sales × Lead time in days) + Safety stock</strong></p>

            <p>Example: Product sells 6 units/day. Lead time is 25 days. Safety stock is 10 days.</p>

            <p>Reorder point = (6 × 25) + (6 × 10) = 150 + 60 = 210 units</p>

            <p>When your FBA inventory hits 210 units, place your next order immediately. This ensures new stock arrives before you run out.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Set up low-stock alerts</strong></p>

            <p>In Seller Central, you can set automatic email alerts when inventory drops below a certain threshold. Set this threshold at your reorder point so you never forget to reorder.</p>

            <p>Better yet, use a tool that monitors inventory levels daily and notifies you when you're approaching stockout territory.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #3: Ignoring inventory turnover ratio</h2>

            <h3>What it looks like</h3>

            <p>You're making sales and generating revenue, but your cash flow is terrible. Your money is locked up in inventory that sits for months before selling. Meanwhile, you can't afford to restock your bestsellers or invest in new products.</p>

            <h3>Why it matters</h3>

            <p>Inventory turnover ratio tells you how many times per year you're selling through your entire inventory and replenishing it. It's one of the most important metrics for profitability.</p>

            <p><strong>Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) ÷ Average Inventory Value</strong></p>

            <p>Industry benchmarks for Amazon FBA:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), food, supplements:</strong> 10-15x turnover per year</li>
                <li><strong>Fashion, beauty, home decor:</strong> 6-10x per year</li>
                <li><strong>Electronics, furniture, high-ticket items:</strong> 4-6x per year</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If your turnover is below these benchmarks, you're sitting on too much inventory relative to your sales. That means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your cash is tied up in stock instead of being reinvested</li>
                <li>You're paying more in storage fees</li>
                <li>You're at higher risk of inventory obsolescence (product becomes outdated or seasonal demand ends)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to fix it</h3>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Calculate turnover for each SKU</strong></p>

            <p>Download your Business Report and Inventory Health Report. For each product:</p>

            <p><strong>Annual COGS = Units sold in last 12 months × Cost per unit</strong><br>
            <strong>Average inventory value = (Current FBA inventory × Cost per unit)</strong><br>
            <strong>Turnover ratio = Annual COGS ÷ Average inventory value</strong></p>

            <p>Products with turnover below 4x are dragging down your overall performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Liquidate slow movers</strong></p>

            <p>For products with turnover under 3x and no seasonal upside:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Run a discount promotion to clear excess stock (take a small loss to free up cash)</li>
                <li>Request removal and sell through other channels</li>
                <li>Bundle slow movers with bestsellers ("Buy 1 bestseller, get 1 slow mover at 50% off")</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Focus future inventory purchases on high-turnover products</strong></p>

            <p>If Product A turns over 12x/year and Product B turns 3x/year, you should be investing 4x more capital into Product A. It cycles through faster, generates cash quicker, and carries less risk.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #4: Not accounting for seasonal demand</h2>

            <h3>What it looks like</h3>

            <p>You order 200 units in August based on average monthly sales. Diwali hits in October. Demand spikes 5x. You sell out in 8 days and miss the rest of the season. Or worse — you over-order for Diwali, sell through 60% during the festival, and sit on the remaining 40% for the next 6 months paying storage fees.</p>

            <h3>Why it happens</h3>

            <p>Most sellers use average sales data to make restock decisions. But averages hide seasonal peaks and valleys. If you sell 100 units/month on average but 300 units in October and only 40 units in March, your "average" doesn't help you plan.</p>

            <h3>How to fix it</h3>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Analyze year-over-year seasonal patterns</strong></p>

            <p>Pull your Business Report for the last 2 years (if you have it). Chart monthly sales for each SKU. Look for clear patterns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Diwali/festival season spike (September-November)</li>
                <li>Wedding season spike (November-February in North India, April-June in South)</li>
                <li>Back-to-school spike (June-July)</li>
                <li>New Year fitness spike (January for health/fitness products)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Adjust restock quantities for peak season</strong></p>

            <p>If your product historically sees a 3x spike during Diwali, don't order based on average sales. Order based on peak sales × expected duration.</p>

            <p>Example: Normal month = 80 units. Diwali months (Oct-Nov) = 240 units each. You should have 480+ units in FBA by end of September to avoid stockouts.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Plan liquidation for post-season excess</strong></p>

            <p>If you over-order for a seasonal spike and have leftovers, don't let them sit for a year waiting for the next season. Run a clearance sale in December to convert that inventory back into cash before New Year.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #5: Not factoring in long-term storage fees</h2>

            <h3>What it looks like</h3>

            <p>You send inventory to FBA and forget about it. Six months later, you get hit with long-term storage fees on units that have been sitting for 181+ days. The fees are painful — and now your product is marked as aged inventory, which Amazon penalizes in search ranking.</p>

            <h3>Amazon's long-term storage fee structure</h3>

            <p>If inventory sits in FBA for more than 365 days, Amazon charges an additional ₹45 per cubic foot (on top of regular monthly storage fees). This is assessed on the 15th of each month.</p>

            <p>These fees can easily exceed the cost of the product itself. A ₹300 item taking up 0.5 cubic feet for 12 months:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular storage: ₹26 × 12 months × 0.5 = ₹156</li>
                <li>Long-term storage (after 365 days): ₹45 × 0.5 = ₹22.50/month extra</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Over time, you're paying more in fees than the product is worth.</p>

            <h3>How to fix it</h3>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Monitor inventory age in your Inventory Health Report</strong></p>

            <p>Go to Inventory > Manage FBA Inventory > Inventory Health. This shows you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Units aged 181-330 days (at risk of long-term fees)</li>
                <li>Units aged 331-365 days (fees kicking in soon)</li>
                <li>Units aged 365+ days (already accruing extra fees)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Create a removal plan for aged inventory</strong></p>

            <p>If units are approaching 180 days with no sales velocity, you have three options:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Run a steep discount</strong> – Sell at cost or below to clear it out before fees hit</li>
                <li><strong>Request removal</strong> – Pay ₹25-50/unit to ship it back to you or a liquidator</li>
                <li><strong>Request disposal</strong> – Amazon destroys it for ₹15/unit (last resort, but cheaper than paying storage indefinitely)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Avoid sending more inventory than you can sell in 6 months</strong></p>

            <p>Calculate your expected sell-through time before shipping to FBA. If a product only sells 20 units/month, don't send 300 units. You'll hit aged inventory before you sell through.</p>

            <h2>How Vikreya helps you manage inventory smarter</h2>

            <p>Inventory management shouldn't require a finance degree. Your Business Report has all the data you need — you just need it organized in a way that tells you what to do.</p>

            <p>Vikreya's inventory analysis breaks it down for you:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Upload your Business Report</strong> (last 90 days recommended)</li>
                <li><strong>Get ranked product performance</strong> – bestsellers vs slow movers, sorted by profitability</li>
                <li><strong>See exact restock quantities</strong> – based on your sell-through rate and lead time</li>
                <li><strong>Identify aged inventory risks</strong> – products approaching long-term storage fee thresholds</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You'll know exactly which products to restock, how much to order, and which SKUs to liquidate before they become a liability.</p>

            <h2>Case study: Home goods seller increases profit margin by 18%</h2>

            <p>Priya sells kitchen and home organization products on Amazon.in. Her catalog has 23 SKUs. In early 2024, her profit margin was 14% after all fees and costs — decent but not great.</p>

            <p>After analyzing her Business Report, she realized:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5 SKUs were slow movers with turnover under 3x/year, tying up ₹85,000 in capital</li>
                <li>Her bestseller (40% of total revenue) kept stocking out because she was splitting inventory budget evenly across all SKUs</li>
                <li>3 SKUs were approaching 180 days with minimal sales, soon to trigger long-term storage fees</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What she did:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ran a flash sale to clear the 3 aged inventory SKUs at 30% discount (took a small loss, freed up ₹22,000 in capital)</li>
                <li>Discontinued 2 chronic slow movers entirely</li>
                <li>Reallocated saved capital to doubling inventory on her top 3 bestsellers</li>
                <li>Set up reorder alerts at calculated reorder points for her top SKUs</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Results after 90 days:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Profit margin jumped from 14% to 32%</li>
                <li>Zero stockouts on bestsellers for 3 consecutive months</li>
                <li>Storage fees dropped by 48%</li>
                <li>Cash freed up allowed her to test 2 new product launches</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ongoing inventory discipline: quarterly reviews</h2>

            <p>Good inventory management isn't a one-time fix. It's a habit. Set a quarterly calendar reminder to:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Download your Business Report (last 90 days)</li>

            <h2>FAQ: Amazon FBA inventory management India</h2>

            <h3>Q: What's a good inventory turnover ratio for my category?</h3>
            <p>Depends on category. FMCG/consumables should aim for 10-15x/year. Fashion/beauty 6-10x. Electronics 4-6x. If you're significantly below these, you're overstocked.</p>

            <h3>Q: Should I keep inventory in Amazon's warehouses or use FBA later?</h3>
            <p>For fast-moving products, ship directly to FBA. For slow movers or products you're testing, consider keeping inventory locally and using Seller Fulfilled Prime or shipping to FBA in smaller batches.</p>

            <h3>Q: How much safety stock should I keep?</h3>
            <p>General rule: 7-15 days of average daily sales. More if your supplier is unreliable or shipping from overseas. Less if you have quick access to restocks.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I negotiate payment terms with suppliers to improve cash flow?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. Instead of paying 100% upfront, ask for Net-30 or Net-45 terms. This means you receive and sell inventory before paying for it, dramatically improving cash flow.</p>

            <h2>Stop bleeding money on inventory mistakes</h2>

            <p>Every day you're overstocked on slow movers, you're paying Amazon storage fees. Every day your bestseller is out of stock, you're losing sales and organic rank. These aren't dramatic disasters — they're silent profit killers.</p>

            <p>The fix isn't complicated. Look at your data. Stock what sells. Cut what doesn't. Reorder before you run out. That's it.</p>
