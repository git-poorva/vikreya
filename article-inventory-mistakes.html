            <h1>5 Inventory Mistakes That Cost Amazon Sellers the Most</h1>
            <p class="article-lead">Most Amazon.in sellers manage inventory on gut feel. That works until it doesn't — and when it fails, it fails expensively. These are the five mistakes we see most often, and what the data actually says to do instead.</p>

        </header>

        <div class="article-content">
            <h2>Mistake 1: Restocking based on gut feel, not sell-through rate</h2>
            <p>The right restock quantity is <strong>daily sales rate × lead time + safety stock</strong>. If your product sells 10 units/day, your supplier takes 15 days, and you want 7 days of safety stock, you restock when you hit 220 units. Most sellers guess this. Your Business Report gives you the exact daily sales rate — use it.</p>

            <h2>Mistake 2: Treating all products the same</h2>
            <p>Your bestseller and your slowest mover need completely different inventory strategies. Your top 3 products probably drive 60–70% of revenue — those need aggressive stock levels. Your slow movers are accumulating long-term storage fees (₹150+ per cubic foot per month after 365 days on Amazon.in). Download your Business Report and rank products by revenue contribution. The bottom 20% deserve a serious review.</p>

            <h2>Mistake 3: Not accounting for Amazon's receiving delays</h2>
            <p>When you create a shipment to FBA, plan for Amazon's actual receiving time — not what you hope for. During peak periods (Diwali season, year-end), FBA receiving can take 10–14 days after delivery. If your lead time calculation doesn't include this, you'll go out of stock even when you "planned" correctly. Build in an extra 7 days during Oct–Jan.</p>

            <h2>Mistake 4: Ignoring long-term storage fee thresholds</h2>
            <p>Amazon charges significantly higher storage fees for inventory that's been in FBA for over 365 days. Go to Reports → Fulfillment → Inventory Age. Any units with 300+ days of age need a plan right now: either run a promotion to clear them, create a removal order, or liquidate. Long-term storage fees on slow-moving products add up quickly.</p>

            <h2>Mistake 5: No stockout alert system</h2>
            <p>Going out of stock on a bestseller doesn't just cost you sales for the days you're out — it hurts your search ranking, which takes weeks to recover. Amazon's algorithm treats stockouts as a signal that your product isn't reliably available. Set up restock alerts in Seller Central (Manage Inventory → Alerts) and cross-check your "Weeks of Cover" column weekly. If it drops below 3 weeks, trigger a restock immediately.</p>
