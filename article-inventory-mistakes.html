<h1>5 Inventory Mistakes Killing Your Amazon Profits</h1>
<p><strong>Read Time: 3 Minutes</strong></p>

<p>Inventory mismanagement is one of the biggest silent profit killers for Amazon sellers in India. Whether you’re doing ₹5L or ₹50L monthly revenue, poor stock planning leads to lost rankings, excess storage fees, and cash flow problems.</p>

<h2>1. Overstocking Without Demand Forecasting</h2>
<p>Ordering bulk inventory without sales data ties up capital and increases long-term FBA storage fees. Many sellers overestimate demand during peak months and get stuck with dead inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Use 60–90 day rolling sales averages and adjust for seasonality before placing POs.</p>

<h2>2. Understocking & Losing Ranking</h2>
<p>Running out of stock hurts more than lost sales. Amazon’s algorithm penalizes inactive listings, and recovering rankings can take weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Maintain a 30–45 day buffer stock based on average daily sales.</p>

<h2>3. Ignoring Restock Lead Time</h2>
<p>Many sellers calculate reorder quantity but forget supplier production + shipping time. This leads to avoidable stockouts.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Reorder Point = (Daily Sales × Lead Time) + Safety Stock</p>

<h2>4. Not Monitoring Inventory Turnover</h2>
<p>Low inventory turnover means cash is stuck. Healthy FBA businesses maintain turnover between 4–8 cycles annually.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Regularly remove slow-moving SKUs or bundle them to improve sell-through.</p>

<h2>5. Ignoring Storage Fee Optimization</h2>
<p>Long-term storage fees can destroy margins. Sellers often ignore aging inventory reports until fees spike.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Run promotions or ads before inventory hits 270–365 days.</p>

<h2>Smart Inventory Strategy for Indian Sellers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Forecast monthly demand</li>
<li>Track sell-through weekly</li>
<li>Plan reorders 45–60 days in advance</li>
<li>Monitor aged inventory reports</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Inventory optimization directly impacts Amazon FBA profitability. Sellers who track data and plan reorders scientifically outperform competitors consistently.</p>
