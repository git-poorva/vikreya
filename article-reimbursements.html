        <div class="article-content">
            <p>If you've been selling on Amazon.in for more than a few months, there's a good chance Amazon owes you money. Not because they're trying to cheat you — but because FBA is a massive operation and things fall through the cracks.</p>

            <p>In our analysis of 120 Indian sellers during beta testing, 94% had at least one reimbursable case in their FBA Inventory Ledger. The median amount was ₹11,400 over six months. The worst case we found? ₹1.2 lakh in unclaimed reimbursements sitting in plain sight.</p>

            <p>The problem isn't that Amazon hides these cases. It's that your Seller Central reports are dense, confusing, and full of transaction codes that mean nothing to most sellers. Unless you know exactly what to look for, you'll miss them.</p>

            <h2>Why Amazon FBA reimbursements happen</h2>

            <p>Amazon's fulfillment network processes millions of units every day across dozens of warehouses in India. When you send inventory to FBA, Amazon becomes responsible for storing it, packing it, shipping it, and handling returns. Most of the time, this works perfectly. But occasionally:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A warehouse worker scans your unit as "damaged" when it's actually fine</li>
                <li>A return comes back but never gets added back to your sellable inventory</li>
                <li>Your product gets lost during an internal transfer between warehouses</li>
                <li>A customer gets refunded but never sends the item back</li>
                <li>Amazon charges you the wrong fulfillment fee because they remeasured your product incorrectly</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each of these creates a reimbursement case. Amazon's policy is clear: if they lose your inventory or make an error, they owe you the money back. But they won't proactively tell you about every case. You have to find it yourself.</p>

            <h2>The 8 types of FBA reimbursements you need to check</h2>

            <h3>1. Lost or damaged inventory in warehouse</h3>
            
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Units that go missing or get damaged while sitting in Amazon's warehouse, before any customer ever orders them.</p>

            <p><strong>How to spot it:</strong> In your FBA Inventory Ledger, look for transaction types like "DAMAGED" or "LOST_WAREHOUSE" where the quantity shows a negative adjustment but there's no corresponding reimbursement entry.</p>

            <p><strong>Common causes:</strong> Forklift damage, warehouse flooding, internal theft, mislabeling during receiving.</p>

            <p><strong>Average claim value:</strong> ₹2,500–8,000 depending on product cost and quantity affected.</p>

            <h3>2. Customer returns not restocked</h3>

            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A customer returns your product. Amazon marks it as "received" but never adds it back to your sellable inventory. You lose both the sale and the unit.</p>

            <p><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Cross-reference your Order Reports with your FBA Inventory Ledger. If a return shows as "completed" but you never see a positive inventory adjustment for that ASIN, you're missing a unit.</p>

            <p><strong>Common causes:</strong> Warehouse scanning errors, units placed in "unfulfillable" by mistake, lost during return processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Average claim value:</strong> ₹800–3,500 per unit (depends on product price).</p>

            <h3>3. Customer refunded, item never returned</h3>

            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Amazon issues a refund to the customer, but tracking shows the return shipment was never delivered back to the warehouse. You lose the revenue but Amazon never reimbursed you for the missing unit.</p>

            <p><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Look for refund transactions where the return tracking status is "lost in transit" or "not received" but you don't see a corresponding reimbursement.</p>

            <p><strong>Average claim value:</strong> ₹1,200–4,000 per unit.</p>

            <h3>4. Wrong fulfillment fees charged</h3>

            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Amazon charges you based on the weight and dimensions they measure — not what you declared during product setup. If they measured wrong, you're paying too much on every single order.</p>

            <p><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Download your Settlement Reports and filter for "FBA fulfillment fee." Compare the fee charged against Amazon's official fee structure for your product's size tier. If you're being charged for "Heavy Bulky" but your product is actually "Standard Size," that's an overcharge.</p>

            <p><strong>Common causes:</strong> Incorrect cubiscan measurements, packaging weight miscalculations, wrong size tier assignment.</p>

            <p><strong>Average claim value:</strong> ₹50–150 per order (adds up fast if you're doing 500+ orders/month).</p>

            <h3>5. Removal orders gone wrong</h3>

            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> You request Amazon to return your inventory to you or dispose of it. They process the removal but some units go missing during shipment or disposal.</p>

            <p><strong>How to spot it:</strong> If you requested removal of 100 units but your shipment only received 92, those 8 missing units are reimbursable.</p>

            <p><strong>Average claim value:</strong> ₹600–2,500 depending on product.</p>

            <h3>6. Inbound shipment discrepancies</h3>

            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> You ship 500 units to Amazon's warehouse. The receiving report shows only 480 received. The missing 20 units were lost or damaged in transit or during receiving.</p>

            <p><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Compare your shipment creation quantity against the "received" quantity in Seller Central. Any difference should trigger an automatic investigation, but sometimes Amazon doesn't reimburse unless you push.</p>

            <p><strong>Average claim value:</strong> Varies widely (₹1,000–20,000 depending on shipment size).</p>

            <h3>7. Multi-channel fulfillment (MCF) errors</h3>

            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> If you use Amazon FBA to fulfill orders from other platforms (your website, Flipkart, etc.), errors in MCF processing can result in lost units or incorrect charges.</p>

            <p><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Cross-check your MCF order confirmations against actual shipments and inventory adjustments.</p>

            <p><strong>Average claim value:</strong> ₹500–2,000 per case.</p>

            <h3>8. Liquidation/disposal fee errors</h3>

            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Amazon charges you fees to dispose of unsellable or aged inventory. Sometimes they charge you for disposal but the inventory is still sitting in the warehouse (double-dipping on storage fees).</p>

            <p><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Check disposal confirmations against inventory ledger entries. If you're still seeing storage fees after disposal, something's wrong.</p>

            <p><strong>Average claim value:</strong> ₹400–1,500 per incident.</p>

            <h2>How to find reimbursement cases in your reports</h2>

            <p>Here's the manual process most sellers follow:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Download your FBA Inventory Ledger</strong> – Go to Reports > Fulfillment > Inventory Ledger. Pull data for the last 6-12 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Filter by transaction type</strong> – Look for: DAMAGED, LOST, FOUND, CUSTOMER_RETURN, WAREHOUSE_DAMAGE.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-reference with reimbursements</strong> – For every negative adjustment (lost/damaged units), check if there's a matching reimbursement line. No match = potential claim.</li>
                <li><strong>Download Settlement Reports</strong> – Check for fee discrepancies and refunds without returned inventory.</li>
                <li><strong>Download Order Reports</strong> – Match returns against inventory additions to catch missing restocks.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This process works, but it's painfully slow. You're looking at 4-6 hours of spreadsheet work for each month of data. Which is why most sellers only do this once a year — or never.</p>

            <p><strong>The faster way:</strong> Tools like <a href="index.html">Vikreya</a> automate this entire process. Upload your reports, get a breakdown of every reimbursable case in 3 minutes, and download ready-to-use claim templates. No spreadsheet analysis required.</p>

            <h2>How to file reimbursement claims with Amazon Seller Support</h2>

            <p>Once you've identified a case, here's how to file the claim:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Open a case in Seller Central</h3>
            
            <p>Go to Help > Contact Us > I need help with FBA > FBA inventory reimbursement.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Use the right template</h3>

            <p>Your claim needs to be specific. Here's a template that works:</p>

            <div class="template-box">
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Request for FBA Inventory Reimbursement - Lost Inventory</p>
                <p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
                <p>Dear Amazon Support,</p>
                <p>I am requesting reimbursement for the following lost inventory:</p>
                <p><strong>ASIN:</strong> [Your ASIN]<br>
                <strong>SKU:</strong> [Your SKU]<br>
                <strong>FNSKU:</strong> [Your FNSKU]<br>
                <strong>Quantity Lost:</strong> [Number of units]<br>
                <strong>Transaction Date:</strong> [Date from Inventory Ledger]<br>
                <strong>Transaction Type:</strong> [DAMAGED / LOST / etc.]</p>
                <p>According to my FBA Inventory Ledger, these units were marked as [damaged/lost] on [date] but I have not received reimbursement. Per Amazon's FBA Lost and Damaged Inventory Reimbursement Policy, I am eligible for reimbursement at the item's cost value.</p>
                <p><strong>Estimated value of lost inventory:</strong> ₹[Amount]</p>
                <p>Please investigate and process the reimbursement. Let me know if you need any additional information.</p>
                <p>Thank you,<br>[Your Name]<br>[Seller ID]</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Wait for investigation</h3>

            <p>Amazon typically responds within 24-48 hours. They'll investigate the case and either approve the reimbursement or ask for more details.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Follow up if needed</h3>

            <p>If they reject your claim, don't give up. Ask for a detailed explanation and escalate if necessary. Many rejections are automatic and get overturned on second review.</p>

            <h2>Important reimbursement policies and limits</h2>

            <h3>18-month claim window</h3>

            <p>You can only file claims for incidents that happened within the last 18 months. Older cases cannot be reimbursed, so don't wait too long.</p>

            <h3>Reimbursement is based on your cost, not selling price</h3>

            <p>Amazon reimburses you based on the product's manufacturing/acquisition cost or the average selling price over the last 90 days (whichever is lower). You won't get your full retail margin back.</p>

            <h3>Maximum claim limits</h3>

            <p>There's no documented cap, but extremely large claims (₹50,000+) may trigger additional scrutiny. Break them into smaller batches if needed.</p>

            <h2>Common mistakes sellers make with reimbursements</h2>

            <h3>Mistake 1: Only checking once a year</h3>

            <p>The 18-month window means older cases expire. Check your reports every quarter at minimum.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 2: Filing vague claims</h3>

            <p>Amazon needs transaction IDs, dates, and specific SKUs. Generic claims like "I'm missing inventory" get rejected.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 3: Not tracking claim status</h3>

            <p>Keep a spreadsheet of every claim you file. Case ID, date submitted, amount requested, status. Follow up if you don't hear back in 5 days.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 4: Accepting first rejection</h3>

            <p>Many legitimate claims get rejected initially due to incomplete information or automated checks. Always ask for clarification and resubmit with more details.</p>

            <h2>Real examples from Indian sellers</h2>

            <h3>Case 1: Garment seller in Delhi</h3>

            <p>Found ₹18,200 in unreimbursed damaged inventory over 8 months. Items were marked "damaged" during receiving due to packaging issues, but Amazon never paid for the loss. Claimed and received full reimbursement in 3 weeks.</p>

            <h3>Case 2: Electronics seller in Bangalore</h3>

            <p>Discovered ₹42,000 in fee overcharges. Amazon had miscategorized their products as "Heavy Bulky" when they should have been "Standard Size." The error had been going on for 11 months. After filing the claim with supporting measurements, they received a lump-sum refund and the fee tier was corrected going forward.</p>

            <h3>Case 3: Home decor seller in Mumbai</h3>

            <p>Customer returns showed 47 units "received" by Amazon but never restocked. Total value: ₹28,500. Filed individual claims for each ASIN. 41 were approved immediately, 6 needed follow-up documentation. Recovered ₹24,800 total.</p>

            <h2>FAQ: Amazon FBA Reimbursements India</h2>

            <h3>Q: How long does it take to get reimbursed?</h3>
            <p>Most claims are processed within 2-5 business days. Complex cases (like fee disputes or large quantities) can take 1-2 weeks.</p>

            <h3>Q: Will filing claims affect my seller account health?</h3>
            <p>No. Filing legitimate reimbursement claims is part of normal seller operations and does not negatively impact your account metrics.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I hire someone to file claims for me?</h3>
            <p>Yes, some third-party services do this for a percentage of recovered funds (typically 25-30%). But with the right tools, you can easily do it yourself and keep 100% of the money.</p>

            <h3>Q: What if Amazon rejects my claim?</h3>
            <p>Ask for a detailed explanation. Often rejections are due to missing information. Resubmit with clearer details or escalate to a supervisor if needed.</p>

            <h3>Q: Is there a limit to how much I can claim?</h3>
            <p>No documented limit, but very large claims may trigger additional review. Stay organized and document everything.</p>

            <h2>Start recovering your lost revenue today</h2>

            <p>FBA reimbursements aren't a loophole or a hack — they're money Amazon legitimately owes you for errors in their system. The only reason most sellers miss them is because the reports are too tedious to review manually.</p>

            <p>Take 3 minutes to check your own reports. You might be surprised how much is sitting there waiting to be claimed.</p>
