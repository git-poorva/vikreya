            <h1>Amazon FBA Reimbursements India 2026: What You're Missing</h1>
            <p class="article-lead">Amazon owes most Indian FBA sellers money right now. Not because they're dishonest — because FBA is a giant operation and things fall through the cracks. Here's what to look for and how to claim it.</p>
            <div class="article-meta">

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>In our analysis of 120 Amazon.in FBA sellers during beta, <strong>94% had at least one reimbursable case</strong> sitting unclaimed. The median recoverable amount was ₹11,400 over six months. One seller had ₹1.2 lakh just waiting to be filed.</p>
            <p>Amazon won't proactively tell you about these cases. You have to find them. Here are the five most common types — and where to look.</p>

            <h2>The 5 reimbursement types that matter most</h2>

            <h3>1. Lost or damaged warehouse inventory</h3>
            <p>Units that go missing or get damaged inside Amazon's warehouse. Look in your <strong>FBA Inventory Ledger</strong> (Reports → Fulfillment → Inventory Ledger) for transaction types like <code>DAMAGED</code> or <code>LOST_WAREHOUSE</code> with no matching reimbursement. Average claim: ₹2,500–8,000.</p>

            <h3>2. Customer returns not restocked</h3>
            <p>A return gets marked "received" but never added back to sellable inventory. Cross-reference your Order Reports with your Inventory Ledger — if a return is complete but no positive inventory adjustment follows, you're owed a unit. Average claim: ₹800–3,500 per unit.</p>

            <h3>3. Wrong fulfillment fees</h3>
            <p>Amazon charges fees based on their measurements, not yours. If they've put your product in the wrong size tier, you're overcharged on every order. Compare the "FBA fulfillment fee" in your Settlement Reports against Amazon's fee calculator for your actual dimensions. Even ₹50/order adds up fast at volume.</p>

            <h3>4. Inbound shipment shortages</h3>
            <p>You ship 200 units, Amazon receives 187. Those 13 missing units are reimbursable. Compare your shipment quantity against the "received" count in your Shipping Queue. Amazon often doesn't reimburse unless you explicitly file a case.</p>

            <h3>5. Refund issued, item never returned</h3>
            <p>Amazon refunds the customer, but the return was never actually delivered back to the warehouse. Find these in your Order Reports — look for refunds where return status is blank or "lost in transit" with no corresponding reimbursement entry.</p>

            <h2>How to file (the fast version)</h2>
            <p>Go to <strong>Help → Contact Us → FBA issue → Inventory reimbursement</strong>. Include the ASIN, FNSKU, quantity, transaction date, and exact transaction type from your ledger. Vague claims get delayed. Amazon typically responds in 3–7 business days.</p>

            <div class="template-box">
                <p><strong>Template that works:</strong></p>
                <p>Subject: FBA Inventory Reimbursement Request – Lost Units<br><br>
                I'm requesting reimbursement for lost inventory:<br>
                ASIN: [X] | FNSKU: [X] | Qty: [X] | Date: [X] | Transaction type: LOST_WAREHOUSE<br><br>
                I've cross-referenced my FBA Inventory Ledger and cannot find a matching reimbursement entry. Please investigate and reimburse per Amazon's FBA Policy.</p>
            </div>

            <p>If they deny the claim, escalate once with the specific ledger data. Most legitimate claims resolve on the second contact.</p>
