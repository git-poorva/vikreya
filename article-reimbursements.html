<h1>Amazon FBA Reimbursements: Money You're Missing</h1>
<p><strong>Read Time: 2–3 Minutes</strong></p>

<p>Many Amazon FBA sellers in India lose 1–3% of annual revenue due to unclaimed reimbursements. Lost inventory, damaged returns, and incorrect fee charges often go unnoticed.</p>

<h2>1. Lost or Damaged Inventory</h2>
<p>Amazon occasionally misplaces or damages units in fulfillment centers.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Audit inventory adjustment reports monthly.</p>

<h2>2. Customer Return Errors</h2>
<p>Refunds are sometimes issued without the item being returned.</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> Compare return reports with received inventory.</p>

<h2>3. Incorrect Weight & Fee Charges</h2>
<p>Incorrect product dimensions can inflate FBA fees.</p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Regularly review fee preview reports.</p>

<h2>4. Removal & Disposal Errors</h2>
<p>Items marked disposed may still be sellable.</p>

<h2>How to Recover Reimbursements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download transaction reports monthly</li>
<li>Audit inventory adjustments</li>
<li>Track return discrepancies</li>
<li>File cases within claim windows</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Even a ₹10–15 lakh seller can recover ₹50,000–₹2,00,000 annually through systematic FBA audits.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Amazon reimbursements are often overlooked profit leaks. Regular audits ensure you recover what you’re owed.</p>
