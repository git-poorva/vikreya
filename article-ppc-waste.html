            <p>Most Amazon India sellers running Sponsored Products campaigns are throwing away 30-40% of their ad budget on keywords that will never convert. Not keywords that might convert eventually with optimization — keywords that are fundamentally wrong for their products.</p>

            <p>A seller in Pune selling premium leather wallets was paying ₹8/click for "wallet men cheap." 487 clicks over 3 months. Zero orders. ₹3,896 gone. Another seller in Chennai running ads for organic turmeric powder kept getting clicks for "haldi powder bulk 25kg" — commercial buyer searches that never converted to retail sales. ₹12,300 wasted in 8 weeks.</p>

            <p>These aren't edge cases. In our analysis of 90 Search Term Reports from Indian sellers, the average account had 18-25 keywords with 50+ clicks and zero conversions. That's ₹15,000-25,000 per month burning for nothing.</p>

            <p>The good news? Your Search Term Report already tells you which keywords are the problem. You just need to know how to read it.</p>

            <h2>Why Amazon PPC wastes money on bad keywords</h2>

            <p>Amazon's ad algorithm is designed to maximize clicks and impressions — not your profit. When you run broad match or phrase match campaigns, Amazon will show your ad for any search term it thinks is "related" to your keywords.</p>

            <p>Sometimes the algorithm gets it right. Often, it doesn't. Here's what typically happens:</p>

            <h3>The broad match trap</h3>

            <p>You target "yoga mat" in broad match, hoping to capture buyers searching for yoga mats. Amazon also shows your ad for: yoga mat cleaner, yoga mat bag, yoga mat spray, yoga mat strap, kids yoga mat, extra thick yoga mat (when yours is standard), foldable yoga mat (when yours isn't).</p>

            <p>Each click costs you money. Most won't convert because the searcher wants something different than what you're selling.</p>

            <h3>The keyword cannibalization problem</h3>

            <p>You're running multiple campaigns and ad groups. "Protein powder" appears in 3 different campaigns with different bids. Amazon enters all three into the auction for the same search, driving up your costs and competing against yourself.</p>

            <h3>The misspelling/variant drain</h3>

            <p>Amazon shows your ad for common misspellings and variants. Some convert fine. Others are just noise. "Led bulb" might work. "Led bulb holdr" probably won't (the searcher is looking for a holder, not a bulb).</p>

            <h2>What makes a keyword "dead" vs. just underperforming?</h2>

            <p>Not every keyword with zero sales needs to be killed immediately. New campaigns need time to gather data. Some high-value keywords have naturally low conversion rates but still profitable.</p>

            <p>Here's how to tell the difference:</p>

            <h3>Dead keyword criteria:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>50+ clicks with zero orders</strong> – After 50 clicks, you have enough data. If there are no conversions, the keyword is wrong for your product.</li>
                <li><strong>Fundamentally wrong intent</strong> – Keywords like "free," "bulk wholesale," "DIY tutorial," "how to make" when you're selling a finished product.</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong price expectation</strong> – "Cheap," "budget," "under 100" when your product is ₹800+.</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong product features</strong> – "Wireless" when your product is wired. "Extra large" when yours is medium. These will never convert no matter how many clicks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Underperforming but saveable keywords:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fewer than 30 clicks</strong> – Not enough data yet. Let it run.</li>
                <li><strong>Good intent, bad bid</strong> – Keyword is relevant, CTR is decent, but CPC is too high. Lower the bid instead of killing it.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal keywords</strong> – "Diwali gifts" underperforms in March but crushes in October. Context matters.</li>
                <li><strong>New product launches</strong> – First 2-3 weeks often have low conversion as Amazon builds relevance. Give it time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to find dead keywords in your Search Term Report</h2>

            <p>Here's the step-by-step process to audit your PPC spend:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Download your Search Term Report</h3>

            <p>In Seller Central: <strong>Advertising > Campaign Manager > Reports > Search Term Report</strong></p>

            <p>Pull data for the last 60-90 days. This gives you enough volume to identify patterns without going so far back that the data is stale.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Sort by spend (highest to lowest)</h3>

            <p>Open the CSV in Excel or Google Sheets. Sort by the "Spend" column, highest to lowest. The top 20-30 search terms usually account for 60-70% of your total ad budget.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Calculate conversion rate for each keyword</h3>

            <p>Create a new column: <strong>Conversion Rate = (Orders / Clicks) × 100</strong></p>

            <p>Any keyword with 50+ clicks and 0% conversion rate is a prime candidate for elimination.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Calculate ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales)</h3>

            <p>ACOS = (Spend / Sales) × 100</p>

            <p>If you're spending ₹500 on a keyword that generates ₹400 in sales, your ACOS is 125%. You're losing money on every sale.</p>

            <p>General benchmarks for Amazon.in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Under 20% ACOS:</strong> Great. Scale up.</li>
                <li><strong>20-35% ACOS:</strong> Profitable for most categories. Optimize but keep running.</li>
                <li><strong>35-50% ACOS:</strong> Marginal. Only worth it if these are top-funnel keywords building awareness.</li>
                <li><strong>50%+ ACOS:</strong> Losing money. Kill or drastically lower bids.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Flag wrong-intent keywords</h3>

            <p>Even if the data is limited, some keywords you can kill immediately based on intent:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Keywords with "free," "download," "tutorial," "DIY"</li>
                <li>Wrong product type (searching for accessories when you sell the main product)</li>
                <li>Commercial bulk searches when you're retail-focused</li>
                <li>Competitor brand names (unless you're legitimately targeting conquest)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What to do with dead keywords: kill vs. negative vs. reduce bid</h2>

            <p>Once you've identified the culprits, you have three options:</p>

            <h3>Option 1: Add as negative keyword (recommended)</h3>

            <p>This tells Amazon to never show your ad for this search term again. Use this for fundamentally wrong keywords.</p>

            <p>How to add negatives in Seller Central:<br>
            Campaign Manager > Select Campaign > Negative Keywords > Add Negative Keyword</p>

            <p>You can add negatives at the campaign level (blocks across all ad groups) or ad group level (more granular control).</p>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use negative exact match for specific bad terms, and negative phrase match to block variations. For example, adding "cheap" as negative phrase match blocks "cheap yoga mat," "yoga mat cheap," "best cheap yoga mat," etc.</p>

            <h3>Option 2: Reduce bid drastically</h3>

            <p>If the keyword is borderline relevant but just too expensive, try lowering the bid by 50-70% instead of killing it completely. This keeps you in the auction for bottom-of-page placements (cheaper clicks) while avoiding top-of-search overspend.</p>

            <h3>Option 3: Pause the campaign/ad group</h3>

            <p>If an entire campaign is bleeding money across multiple keywords, pause it and rebuild from scratch with tighter targeting.</p>

            <h2>Common PPC waste patterns in India-specific searches</h2>

            <h3>Pattern 1: Hindi/English mixing confusion</h3>

            <p>Your product is listed with an English title, but searchers use a mix of Hindi and English (e.g., "चावल basmati rice 5kg"). Amazon's algorithm sometimes struggles with these, leading to irrelevant impressions.</p>

            <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Add negative keywords for Hindi terms that don't match your product, and consider creating Hindi variations in your backend keywords if relevant.</p>

            <h3>Pattern 2: City/locality-specific searches</h3>

            <p>Searches like "sofa Delhi," "furniture Bangalore," "groceries Pune delivery" often have low conversion because the searcher is filtering by location, not ready to buy from FBA.</p>

            <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Add major city names as negative keywords if you're not running hyperlocal campaigns.</p>

            <h3>Pattern 3: COD-specific keywords</h3>

            <p>"COD available," "cash on delivery," "pay on delivery" searches have high intent but also high return rates and order cancellations. Depending on your product, these might be worth targeting or blocking.</p>

            <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Monitor closely. If these keywords have good conversion but terrible return rates, they're costing you in fulfillment fees and not worth the headache.</p>

            <h3>Pattern 4: Wholesale/bulk commercial searches</h3>

            <p>"Wholesale," "bulk," "50 pieces," "distributor price" — these are B2B buyers who will almost never convert on a retail listing.</p>

            <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Negative keyword all wholesale variations unless you're specifically targeting business customers.</p>

            <h2>How to reallocate saved budget to winning keywords</h2>

            <p>Cutting dead keywords isn't just about saving money — it's about redirecting that budget to what works. Here's how:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Identify your high-ROI keywords</h3>

            <p>Sort your Search Term Report by ACOS (lowest to highest). Keywords with under 20% ACOS and consistent sales are your winners.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Increase bids on top performers</h3>

            <p>If a keyword is converting at 15% ACOS and you have budget to spare, try increasing the bid by 20-30% to capture more traffic.</p>

            <p><strong>Monitor daily.</strong> Sometimes a small bid increase pushes you from position 3 to position 1, which can double your clicks but also double your CPC. Track whether the increased cost justifies the volume.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Create dedicated campaigns for best keywords</h3>

            <p>Take your top 5-10 converting keywords and move them into their own exact match campaign. This gives you granular control over bids and budgets without interference from broad match noise.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Test lookalike keywords</h3>

            <p>If "organic turmeric powder" is crushing it at 12% ACOS, test related variations: "pure turmeric powder," "turmeric powder for skin," "haldi powder organic." Sometimes adjacent keywords convert just as well.</p>

            <h2>Advanced tactic: Dayparting and bid adjustments</h2>

            <p>Some keywords convert better at specific times. For example, grocery products often see peak conversions between 6-9 PM when people are planning dinner. Fashion and lifestyle products peak on weekends.</p>

            <p>Amazon doesn't offer built-in dayparting, but you can manually adjust bids based on time-of-day performance data:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Download your Search Term Report segmented by hour (this requires custom reporting or third-party tools)</li>
                <li>Identify peak conversion hours for your product category</li>
                <li>Increase bids during peak hours, decrease during off-hours</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This is advanced stuff and requires constant monitoring, but sellers who do this report 15-20% improvement in ROAS (return on ad spend).</p>

            <h2>Case study: Electronics seller cuts ACOS from 42% to 18%</h2>

            <p>Raj runs an electronics brand selling phone accessories on Amazon.in. In August 2024, his ACOS was 42% and climbing. He was spending ₹38,000/month on ads, generating ₹90,000 in ad-attributed sales — barely breaking even after fees and product costs.</p>

            <p>After analyzing his Search Term Report, he found:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>27 keywords with 50+ clicks and zero orders (₹14,200 wasted in 60 days)</li>
                <li>8 keywords with high spend but terrible ACOS (₹8,900 wasted)</li>
                <li>12 keywords cannibalizing each other across 3 campaigns (driving up CPCs unnecessarily)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What he did:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Added all 27 dead keywords as campaign-level negatives</li>
                <li>Paused 2 underperforming ad groups entirely</li>
                <li>Consolidated the 12 overlapping keywords into a single exact match campaign</li>
                <li>Reallocated the saved budget to his top 6 converting keywords (increased bids by 25%)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Results after 30 days:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>ACOS dropped to 18%</li>
                <li>Total ad spend remained at ₹38,000/month</li>
                <li>Ad-attributed sales jumped to ₹2,11,000</li>
                <li>Profit margin on ad sales went from 8% to 32%</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Same budget. Smarter allocation. 2.3x better results.</p>

            <h2>Ongoing PPC hygiene: make it a monthly habit</h2>

            <p>Cleaning up your PPC isn't a one-time fix. Amazon's algorithm continuously tests new search terms, customer search behavior shifts, and competitors adjust their bids.</p>

            <p>Set a monthly recurring task:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Download last 30 days of Search Term Report</li>
                <li>Identify new dead keywords (50+ clicks, zero orders)</li>
                <li>Add them as negatives</li>
                <li>Check if any top performers have dropped (bid too low, lost placements)</li>
                <li>Adjust bids accordingly</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This takes 30-45 minutes per month if you do it manually. With automation tools like Vikreya, it takes 5 minutes.</p>

            <h2>FAQ: Amazon PPC optimization for Indian sellers</h2>

            <h3>Q: How many clicks should I wait before deciding a keyword is dead?</h3>
            <p>General rule: 50 clicks for low-priced products (under ₹500), 30 clicks for mid-range (₹500-2000), 20 clicks for high-ticket (₹2000+). Higher-priced products have naturally lower conversion rates, so you need less data to make a decision.</p>

            <h3>Q: Should I use automatic campaigns or only manual?</h3>
            <p>Use both, but with different purposes. Automatic campaigns help discover new keywords. Manual campaigns give you control to optimize. Run auto campaigns with a smaller budget (20-30% of total PPC spend) as a keyword discovery tool, then migrate winners to manual exact match campaigns.</p>

            <h3>Q: What's a good ACOS target for my category?</h3>
            <p>Depends on your profit margin. If your product has 40% margin after all fees, you can theoretically afford 40% ACOS and break even. Most sellers target 20-30% to leave room for profit. Categories with high repeat purchase rates (consumables, pet food, beauty) can tolerate higher initial ACOS because of lifetime customer value.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I damage my organic rank by pausing PPC?</h3>
            <p>Short answer: not significantly. Long answer: PPC and organic rank are separate algorithms. However, high-performing PPC campaigns do generate velocity signals (sales, clicks, conversions) that can indirectly help organic rankings. So if you pause a profitable campaign, you might see a slight organic dip due to reduced overall sales velocity, not because of PPC itself.</p>

            <h2>Take control of your ad spend today</h2>

            <p>Most sellers treat Amazon PPC like a black box — turn it on, spend money, hope for the best. The reality is that your Search Term Report gives you complete visibility into what's working and what's not. You just need to actually look at it.</p>

            <p>Take 10 minutes right now. Download your Search Term Report. Sort by spend. Find the top 3 keywords burning the most money with zero conversions. Add them as negatives. That alone could save you ₹5,000-10,000 this month.</p>
